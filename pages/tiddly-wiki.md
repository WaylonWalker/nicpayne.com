[Tiddly Wiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is a great note taking utility for organizing non-linear notes.
I used it to replace my OneNote workflow and my only complaint is I don't have an easy way to access and edit my tiddlers (posts) if I'm not at home.

Basically the tiddlywiki is just an `html` file with a ton of stuff above my head baked in. 
I have a barebones repo with some notes and a nice starter tiddly wiki init on [my github](https://github.com/nicpayne713/tiddlywiki-tutorial).

Usage is pretty basic... Just grab the `notebook/template.htlm` and save it to anywhere convenient on your computer.
I put mine on my NAS to have the security of backups since I don't keep my tidldlywiki in a git repo (I don't really want to look at the diff).

> I have moved away from my tiddlywiki workflow in favor of this site actually since I can git commit markdown files and build with [markata](https://markata.dev/)

> I still use tiddlywiki for tracking some todo items and questions --- I may have another solution in the future
